                <p class="aboutText">Experience a music player designed completely around your content. Introducing Mikron, the cleanest, most elegant mini player for Apple Music.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="aboutText">Mikron elevates the functionality you love from existing players to new levels. You no longer have to settle for a microscopic window or full-screen view just to see the title of that cool song you've never heard before, because Mikron is resizable to your liking – without having to give up important information.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="aboutText">Mikron keeps the focus on your music, and modifies its design accordingly. Your song's album art is the centerpiece of the app, with a background that changes to match its colour scheme so your tunes never look out of place.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="aboutText">Unlike others, this player is not cluttered with annoying controls that you'll never use. Rather, its interface has been streamlined to solely present rewind, play/pause, fast-forward, and time controls. This way, random elements will never interfere with your favourite songs.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Why should I use a mini player?</h2>
                    <p class="aboutText">Mini players like Mikron are a great way to keep track of the music you're listening to without having to pull up a large media window that wastes space while you're working.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="aboutText">You can also use them as a full-screen window to elegantly present the currently playing song at a gathering, while you're away from your computer, or simply to fill up a secondary display.</p>
